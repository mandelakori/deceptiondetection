# Deception Detection: From Static Texts to Multimodal Signals

This repository contains the research paper "Deception Detection: From Static Texts to Multimodal Signals" by Mandela Logan. The paper explores fraud detection techniques, reflecting on two projects: a static text-based model and a multimodal audio-text model. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, calibration, validation, explainability, and shared engineering practices like MLOps.

## Key Sections

- **Introduction**: Overview of digital fraud risks and the two projects (static text and multimodal audio-text).
- **The Evolving Fraud Landscape**: Discussion on AI-enabled fraud, deepfakes, and the shift to behavioral analysis.
- **Foundational Techniques in Text-Based Fraud Detection**: Covers preprocessing (e.g., text normalization, leetspeak handling), feature engineering (TF-IDF, linguistic features), and modeling paradigms (ML, DL, hybrids).
- **Multimodal Fraud Detection**: Explores audio features (MFCCs, prosodic markers, wav2vec), fusion strategies (early, mid, late), and the "modality gap."
- **MLOps and Production**: Focuses on experiment tracking, drift mitigation, and real-world case studies.
- **Conclusion**: Hybrid approaches, future trends (e.g., LALMs, synthetic data), and comparative analysis.
